How things should be 
discord should have a feed.which will help em 
grow a lot like instagram. instagram has over 
1billion users and 500 million are active users 
i would say .instagram has 110 ,70,69 million
users from us, Brazil,and india .i dont know
how brazil has so many users.but instagram is
having a lot of profit.but instagram is slowly 
goin out of users.Because it is getting toxic
and young generation dont like the way it works.
it is also getting full of boomers no offense.
so this is the time for discord.if they manage 
to update discord to a form where the users 
would have a feed and a profile .Not saying it
has to be a photo and video sharing app.but if 
they do that their 250 million user would jump
into 500 million active users in no time.And 
they would have a lot of nitro users .so thats
my opinion.but i dont even know how i am
 supposed to use github.
